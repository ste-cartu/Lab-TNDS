## Laboratorio di Trattamento Numerico dei Dati Sperimentali (TNDS)

This repository contains all the code I wrote for my Laboratory of Experimental Data, in which we used C++ and MonteCarlo tools to solve some simple mathematical probelms, such as integration and resolution of differential equations. The folders are organized in the following way:

- Lab1-5: Learning some features of C++ language
- Lab6: Finding the zeroes of a function
- Lab7: Making definite integrals
- Lab8-9: Integrating differential equations
- Lab10: Integrating functions with MonteCarlo methods
- Lab11: Simulating an experimental set
